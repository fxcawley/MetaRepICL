# Proposal: In-Context Learning as Meta-Representation Alignment via Kernel Ridge Regression in Transformers

## Summary

We propose to formalize and test the claim that a transformer’s few-shot adaptation implements **kernel ridge regression (KRR) on its hidden representations**—equivalently, *meta-representation alignment*. We will (i) give constructive expressivity results showing a depth-$d$ transformer can simulate $t=O(d)$ iterations of a KRR solver (conjugate gradient, CG) on features $\phi(x)$ already computed in earlier layers; (ii) extend these results from linear attention to standard **softmax attention**; and (iii) derive sample- and compute-scaling consequences, then validate on mechanistic probes and ICL benchmarks. Prior works show transformers can implement gradient descent / ridge on linear tasks and often behave like kernel regressors; we aim to **tighten** these into capacity-conditioned guarantees with explicit architectural mappings and error rates. ([arXiv][1])

## Specific Aims

**Aim 1 (Expressivity):** Prove that a decoder-style transformer with *linear attention* can compute the $t$-step CG approximation to KRR over hidden representations, with prediction error decaying at the standard CG rate in the ridge metric. (Constructive mapping from attention/MLP/residuals to mat-vecs, reductions, and affine updates.)

**Aim 2 (Softmax attention):** Show that a standard softmax transformer can either (A) perform KRR for an exponential kernel induced by QK scaling, or (B) approximate the dot-product KRR mat-vec to accuracy $\epsilon$ per iteration with a constant number of additional heads and a small corrective MLP; total error $O(\epsilon t)$ plus CG error.

**Aim 3 (Capacity/conditioning laws):** Derive explicit **depth–accuracy** ($t$ CG steps) and **width–rank** (minimum width $\Omega(p)$ to carry $\phi$; low-rank approximation error otherwise) tradeoffs; quantify dependence on $\kappa(K+\lambda I)$.

**Aim 4 (Mechanistic & empirical validation):** Build probes that recover the CG state ($\alpha,r,p$) from activations; test on controlled ICL tasks (linear/GLM) and realistic prompts; verify predicted scaling and failure modes (e.g., collinear supports, small $\lambda$). Baselines include learned GD-ICL and closed-form ridge predictors from the literature. ([arXiv][2])

## Background & Motivation

Evidence suggests that ICL often implements **standard estimators** (least squares, ridge, GD) and that attention behaves like a **kernel smoother**, aligning queries with support examples in a learned feature space. However, most results either focus on *linear tasks* or provide algorithmic constructions without capacity-conditioned **error bounds** under actual transformer primitives (residuals, softmax, masking). We address this gap with **constructive, rate-explicit theorems** and diagnostics that are falsifiable in experiments. ([arXiv][1])

## Problem Statement (formal)

Given support $\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^k$, hidden features $\phi(x)\in\mathbb{R}^p$ produced by earlier layers, ridge $\lambda>0$, and $K=\Phi\Phi^\top$ with $\Phi=[\phi(x_i)^\top]_i$, the KRR predictor is
$f^\star(x)=k(x)^\top (K+\lambda I)^{-1}y,\quad k(x)=\Phi \phi(x).$
We seek transformer architectures that **compute** $f^\star(x)$ (exactly or to accuracy $\varepsilon$) *in forward pass* under causal masking, and to characterize the **depth/width** needed for an approximation error target.

---

## Preliminary Theorem (to be proved/extended in Aim 1–2)

**Theorem (LAT ⇒ KRR via CG; constructive).**
For any $t\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists a depth-$O(t)$, width-$\Omega(p+r)$ decoder with *linear attention* (unnormalized dot-products) over the $k$ support tokens + 1 query + 1 aggregator that outputs $f_t(x)=k(x)^\top \alpha_t$, where $\alpha_t$ is the $t$-step CG iterate for $(K+\lambda I)\alpha=y$. The prediction error obeys

$$
|f_t(x)-f^\star(x)| \;\le\; \sqrt{k(x)^\top (K+\lambda I)^{-1}k(x)}\;\cdot\; 2\Big(\frac{\sqrt{\kappa}-1}{\sqrt{\kappa}+1}\Big)^t \|\alpha^\star\|_{K+\lambda I},
$$

with $\kappa$ the condition number of $K+\lambda I$. Each CG step is realized by one attention mat-vec for $Kp$, residual add for $\lambda p$, two global reductions via an aggregator token, and token-wise affine updates. *(Proof strategy: explicit parameterization mapping mat-vecs/reductions/updates to attention+MLP.)*

**Corollary (softmax attention).**
(A) A softmax head implements KRR for the exponential kernel $\tilde{K}_{ij}=\exp(\langle U\phi_i,U\phi_j\rangle/\tau)$; CG and the bound above hold with $K\to\tilde{K}$. (B) Alternatively, two-head re-scaling + a 2-layer MLP approximate the unnormalized dot-product mat-vec to error $\epsilon$; total predictor error adds $O(\epsilon t)$. *(Proof strategy: kernel smoother view of attention; normalization correction via auxiliary head and MLP.)* ([arXiv][3])

## Research Plan & Work Packages

### WP1 — Formal expressivity (Aims 1–2)

1. **Constructive mapping (LAT):**

   * *Lemma A (mat-vec):* attention with $q_j=\phi(x_j)$, $k_i=\phi(x_i)$, $v_i=p_i$ yields $(Kp)_j$.
   * *Lemma B (reductions):* aggregator token computes $\sum_i r_i^2$, $\sum_i p_i(Ap)_i$; broadcast scalars back.
   * *Lemma C (updates):* MLP + residuals execute $\alpha\!\leftarrow\!\alpha+\gamma p$, $r\!\leftarrow\!r-\gamma Ap$, $p\!\leftarrow\!r+\beta p$.
   * *Deliverable:* full proof with causal mask, parameter counts, and exact width lower bound $m\ge p+\text{(channels)}$.
     **Status:** proof sketch complete; full formalization TBD.

2. **Softmax extension:**

   * **Route A:** treat softmax as exponential kernel ⇒ immediate KRR expressivity (map $U,\tau$ to kernel choice).
   * **Route B:** emulate unnormalized mat-vec to $\epsilon$ using extra head(s) + MLP re-scaling; bound operator-norm error propagation across CG iterations.
     **Stub:** tight constants for head count, width, and $\epsilon$-dependence.

3. **Capacity/conditioning laws:**

   * Derive **depth–accuracy** via CG rate and **width–rank** via carrying $\phi$ and low-rank approximations of $K$.
   * If width $m<p$, formalize approximation as KRR on a rank-$m$ sketch $\hat{K}$; bound $\|f_{\hat{K}}-f_K\|$ by spectral tail.
     **Stub:** precise perturbation bounds for query error $|k(x)^\top(A^{-1}-\hat{A}^{-1})y|$.

**Relevant prior:** constructions for GD/ridge ICL and theory for transformers as statisticians (ridge, Lasso, GLMs). We build a *CG-based* solver with explicit aggregator mechanics and softmax normalization handling. ([arXiv][1])

---

### WP2 — Mechanistic probes & falsification (Aim 4)

* **State recovery:** linear probes for $\alpha,r,p$ at pre-specified layers/heads; ablate aggregator head and observe degradation consistent with missing reductions.
* **Knob sweeps:** $\lambda$, support conditioning, temperature, depth $d$, width $m$; check predicted scaling and failure when $\kappa$ is large.
* **Task ladder:** synthetic linear regression → GLMs → heteroskedastic / mixture tasks; compare with “Transformers as Statisticians” constructions and GD-ICL baselines. ([NeurIPS][4])

**Success criteria (mechanistic):** CG-state cosine similarity >0.9; removal of the “mat-vec head” mimics dropping $Kp$ in CG; changing $\lambda$ shifts predictions as ridge theory predicts.
**Success criteria (behavioral):** empirical error tracks $\big(\frac{\sqrt{\kappa}-1}{\sqrt{\kappa}+1}\big)^t$ as depth increases; low-rank width bottlenecks match spectral tail predictions.

---

### WP3 — Empirical ICL benchmarks

* **Benchmarks:** regression ICL suites and controlled function classes (linear, polynomial kernels with GLU layers), plus small language ICL tasks with structured labels to read out $y$. ([Journal of Machine Learning Research][5])
* **Baselines:** closed-form ridge oracle on frozen $\phi$; GD-ICL (fixed step/learned step); meta-learned adapters.
* **Metrics:** RMSE vs depth; agreement with KRR oracle; probe-recoverability; compute/latency.
* **Ablations:** head sharing vs dedicated mat-vec head; aggregator communication patterns; temperature/normalization.
  **Stub:** finalize dataset list and tokenization for numeric targets in LM prompts.

---

## Risks & Mitigations

* **Softmax normalization leakage:** Difficulty in emulating *unnormalized* mat-vec precisely. *Mitigation:* adopt exponential-kernel KRR as main theorems (Route A); treat dot-product KRR as an approximation (Route B) with explicit $\epsilon$ budgeting. ([arXiv][3])
* **Representation drift:** If upper-layer $\phi$ is not stable across tasks, KRR alignment may not predict behavior. *Mitigation:* freeze a representation subspace with probes; or co-train $\phi$ with an oracle KRR loss for diagnostics.
* **Ill-conditioning:** $\kappa\gg1$ slows CG. *Mitigation:* include diagonal preconditioners achievable with token-wise scaling in MLP; study $\lambda$–accuracy trade-off.

## Expected Contributions

1. **Capacity-conditioned theorems**: depth–accuracy and width–rank laws for KRR-style ICL under causal masking.
2. **Mechanistic construction**: attention/MLP wiring that exactly corresponds to a CG solver, including aggregator-based reductions.
3. **Softmax bridge**: kernel choice (exponential) or $\epsilon$-approximate unnormalized mat-vec with explicit head/width costs.
4. **Diagnostics**: probes/ablations to test the theory in trained models.

## Timeline (aggressive but realistic)

## Resources

Single-node A100s suffice for synthetic/GLM ICL suites; small LMs (<1B) for language-style ICL. Standard infra only.

## Open Technical Stubs (to be filled during project)

* **S1:** Tight constants for head count and width in the $\epsilon$-approximate mat-vec under softmax (operator-norm bounds per block).
* **S2:** Formal preconditioner realizable with token-wise channel scalings; resulting rate $\rho(P^{-1}A)$.
* **S3:** Multi-output $r>1$ vectorization details (block CG vs shared mat-vec).
* **S4:** Stability of $f^\star$ under feature perturbations $\phi\to\hat{\phi}$ realized by earlier layers; Lipschitz constants in terms of $\|K-\hat{K}\|$.
* **S5:** Precise causal-masking proof obligations (no information leakage from query to supports before final readout).

* We treat the lower stack as providing $\phi$ (fixed for the theorem); empirical sections will study how deviations $\hat{\phi}$ perturb the KRR solution.
* Core expressivity result uses linear attention for clarity; softmax-only results adopt exponential kernels or $\epsilon$-approximation.
* Aggregator token is permitted (standard in many mechanistic constructions); causal mask enforced.
